A custom JS script to enhance https://www.allegro.cc/ forums.
Copyright Â© 2010, 2012-2013, 2018, 2021 Brandon McCaig

This script is used to "enhance" the user experience on the forums at
https://www.allegro.cc/. You may hotlink it, copy it, modify it, or
distribute it; but I ask that if you do distribute it, you leave this
notice intact and note your changes after it).

  Hosted version:    https://www.castopulence.org/js/acc.js
  Minfied (maybe):   https://www.castopulence.org/js/acc.min.js
  Bleeding edge:     https://www.castopulence.org/js/acc.dev.js

It depends on jQuery and jQuery UI. Be sure to add both to the list of
external JavaScript scripts before this script. A convenient way is by
using the Google API servers, which Google encourages you to do anyway[1].

It also [optionally] depends on jszip, which is used to turn named <code>
blocks into a zip file with the file contents. You only need jszip if you
intend to use this (not too many people name their <code> tags anyway, but
I do :P).

For example, add the following lines to your external JavaScript script
list:

https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js
https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.2/jquery-ui.min.js
https://www.castopulence.org/js/jszip.js
https://www.castopulence.org/js/acc.min.js

You must now invoke bam.install() in order for acc.js to actually be
executed now (perhaps it should be in a bam.accjs namespace..). This is
more or less just the "always run" stuff. You can still invoke individual
methods manually, of course.

As one might expect, it comes with NO WARRANTY, etc. USE AT OWN RISK. Also
note that it may periodically break as I develop live so you might
experience issues on https://www.allegro.cc/ if you're hotlinking (or
otherwise using a broken version). ^_^ I am not to be held liable for
this. Host your own copy to avoid such breakage.
