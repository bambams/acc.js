A custom JS script to enhance http://www.allegro.cc forums.
Copyright Â© 2010 Brandon McCaig

This script is used to "enhance" the user experience on the forums at
http://www.allegro.cc. You may hotlink it[1], copy it, modify it, or
distribute it; but I ask that if you do copy or modify it, you leave
this copyright notice intact.

It depends on jQuery and jQuery UI. Be sure to add both
to the list of external JavaScript scripts before this script. A
convenient way is by using the Google API servers, which Google
encourages you to do anyway[2].

It also [optionally] depends on jszip, which is used to turn named <code>
blocks into a zip file with the file contents. You only need jszip if you
intend to use this (not too many people name their <code> tags anyway, but
I do :P).

For example, add the following lines to your external JavaScript
script list:

http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js
http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.7.2/jquery-ui.min.js
http://www.castopulence.org/js/jszip.js
http://www.castopulence.org/js/acc.min.js

As one might expect, it comes with NO WARRANTY, etc. USE AT OWN RISK.
Also note that it may periodically break as I develop live so you
might experience issues on http://www.allegro.cc if you're hotlinking
(or otherwise using a broken version). ^_^ I am not to be held liable
for this.
